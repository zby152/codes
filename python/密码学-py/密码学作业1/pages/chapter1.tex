\section{vigenere密码的加密程序}
以下将介绍使用vigenere密码的加密程序将一段明文加密成相应的密文

\subsection{编写思路}
    首先将明文中的空格去掉,只保留明文中的字母,然后利用vigenere的方法将明文的下标与密文的下标相加之后模除26即可得到密文的下标,
    将密文输出即可。

    \subsubsection{加密过程1}
        明文为:I am alive here, my beloved, for the reason to adore you. Oh!How anxious I have been 
        for you and how sorry I am about all you must have suffered in having no news from us. May 
        heaven grant that this letter reaches you. Do not write to me, this would compromise all of 
        us and above all,do not return under any circumstances. It is known that it was you who helped 
        us to get away from here and all would be lost if you should show yourself.We are guarded day 
        and night. I do not care you are not here. Do not be troubled on my account. Nothing will happen
        to me. The national assemble will show leniency. Farewell the most loved of men. Be quiet if you
        can take care of yourself.For myself I cannot write any more, but nothing in the world could 
        stop me to adore you up to the death.\\

    \subsubsection{加密过程2}
        明文为:It was the best of times.It was the worst of times. It was the age of wisdom. It was the 
        age offoolishness. It was the epoch of belief. It was the epoch of incredulity. It was the season
        of light. It was the season of darkness. It was the spring of hope. It was the winter of despair.
        We had everything before us. We had nothing before us. We were all going direct to heaven. We were 
        all going direct the other way. In short, the period was so, far like the present period, that some 
        of its noisiest authorities insisted on its being received, for good or for evil, in the superlative 
        degree of comparison only.\\
